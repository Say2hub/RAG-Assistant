RAG-Based Assistant
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that combines document retrieval with natural language generation to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.
📖 Overview
This project implements a RAG-based assistant using Python. It retrieves relevant information from a document corpus and generates responses using a language model, ideal for question-answering and information retrieval tasks.
🚀 Features

Document Retrieval: Efficiently searches a corpus to find relevant documents.
Response Generation: Generates concise, accurate answers using a language model.
Customizable: Easily adapt to different datasets or models.
User-Friendly: Simple interface for querying and obtaining responses.
